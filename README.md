# Hi, Im Alex!
https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-louis-47568628b/


With a background in application engineering and a recent transition into sales, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and business acumen to the field of data analytics. My passion lies in uncovering hidden patterns and trends within complex data, translating them into actionable insights that drive informed decision-making and business growth.

During my tenure as an application engineer, I excelled at analyzing and interpreting vast amounts of technical data to visualize power system needs and identify potential bottlenecks. My ability to distill complex technical information into clear and concise narratives proved invaluable in communicating findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

In my most recent role in sales, I honed my ability to understand business objectives and translate them into data-driven strategies. I spearheaded the development of data-driven sales dashboards and reports, enabling the team to track key performance indicators, identify trends, and make informed decisions that led to a 20% increase in sales revenue.

My technical skillset includes proficiency in SQL, Python, and data visualization tools such as Tableau and Power BI. I am also well-versed in statistical analysis techniques.

As a data analyst, I am driven by the challenge of transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive business success. My ability to bridge the gap between technical and business domains makes me an asset to any organization seeking to harness the power of data for informed decision-making and strategic growth.

I have currently graduated from Tripoleten in Buisiness Intelligence.
Seeking my next project!
